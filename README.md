Wurst
=====

Development
-----------

Install both requirement files.

Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to 1 to enjoy sane development defaults.

Use `python manage.py wurst_dev_seed` to seed your database with something to work with.

Run tests with `py.test`.

Remember flake8 and isort.  Use `npm run fix` to automatically fix style.
